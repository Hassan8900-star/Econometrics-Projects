# Econometrics-Projects
My first project on GitHub
This is a project I did for my Econometrics & Data Analysis class at the University of Toronto.

The project aims to determine whether older condos in Toronto are cheaper than newer ones.
I set out to measure the effect of age on overall condo prices, controlling for square footage, parking, and other amenities using regression analysis.
Hope you learn something new and have fun reading it!
